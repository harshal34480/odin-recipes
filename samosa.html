        Mixing the oil with flour is important– rub it for good 3 to 4 minutes, do so by rubbing between your hands until the oil is well incorporated with the flour. Don’t overwork the dough– you only need to bring the dough together. If you overwork it, the
        samosa will be hard. Dough should be stiff– soft dough will not give crispy samosa. Let the dough rest for around 40 minutes– always remember to let the dough rest for at least 30 to 40 minutes before you start making the samosa. Roll the dough
        evenly and roll it thin– try to roll the dough thin and evenly. If the dough is rolled thick, it will take a long time for the dough to get cooked. Also we all like thin crispy edges of the samosa, agree? But don’t roll it super thin too, else
        the dough will tear apart when you fill it. Do not use any flour while rolling the samosa, you can apply little oil on your rolling pin. Fry the samosa on low heat – the most important thing- always fry the samosa on low heat (not high, not medium),
        that way they will turn crisp. Once they have become light brown in color (after 10 minutes or so), then you can increase the heat and fry on medium heat. Also when you fry on low heat, they won’t get any blisters which they do when you drop them
        in hot oil.

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour (maida) 260 grams</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ajwain carom seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon oil 45 ml + 5 ml</li>
        <li>water to knead the dough, around 6 tablespoons</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the samosa dough. To a large bowl, add flour, ajwain (carom seeds), salt and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the oil and then start mixing with your fingers. Rub the flour with the oil until the oil is well incorporated in all of the flour. Do this for 3 to 4 minutes, you don't want to rush this step. Once incorporated, the mixture resembles crumbs.</li>
        <li>Press some flour between your palm- it should form a shape (& not crumble) - means oil is enough and well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Now, start adding water, little by little and mix to form a stiff dough. Don't overwork the dough and don't knead a soft dough. It should just come together and form a stiff dough. I used around 6 tablespoons of water here.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a moist cloth and let it rest for 40 minutes. I usually soak a paper towel in water and then squeeze out all the water and then cover my dough with that. While the dough is resting, start working on the filling.</li>
    </ol>
