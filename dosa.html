    <h1>Masala Dosa</h1>

    <p>Use a cast iron: I cannot stress this enough! Really guys, if you want to make nice crisp dosa, use a cast iron pan. I know people run away from cast iron since it needs a little maintenance, but once you get a hang of it, you will not go back to
        any other pan for making dosa. This is not to say that you cannot make crisp dosa on a non-stick pan. With this recipe, the dosa will be crisp even on a non-stick. But for that perfect looking dosa, you need even heating and cast iron is the way
        to go! I use one cast iron pan exclusively for making dosas. You would need a 10-inch pan at least to make good sized dosa, however I use this 14-inch cast iron pan for dosa. Add chana dal, toor dal to the batter: now addition of these dals make
        your dosa extra crispy. I do not add these in my “idli-dosa batter” but when I am making a batter exclusively for crisp dosa, then I make sure to add these. Make sure pan is heated enough before pouring the batter: the pan needs to be heated through
        on medium high heat before you pour the batter onto it. I usually sprinkle few drops of water to check if the pan if heated enough or not. The water droplets should sizzle immediately and evaporate when you sprinkle the water on the pan. If they
        don’t, pan needs to be heated more. Rub the pan with an onion dipped in oil before pouring the batter: this helps in preventing the batter from sticking to the pan. Cut an onion in half then insert a fork inside it. Dip the cut onion in oil and
        then rub it onto the pan. Do this step each time after making dosa.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup sona masoori rice or any raw or regular rice, 150 grams</li>
        <li>3/4 cup idli rice parboiled rice, 160 grams</li>
        <li>1/2 cup urad dal gota 100 grams, dehusked whole urad dal or you can use urad dal dhuli (split urad dal)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chana dal 18 grams</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toor dal 18 grams</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon methi seeds fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons poha flattened rice, 18 grams, soaked 20 to 30 minutes before grinding</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon rock salt non-iodide</li>
        <li>ghee or oil to cook the dosa</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>To a large bowl add sona masoori rice, idli rice, urad dal gota, chana dal, toor dal and methi seeds.Rinse everything and soak in around 5 cups water for 5 to 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Soak poha in 1/2 cup water 20 to 30 minutes before grinding the batter.</li>
        <li>Drain water from the rice, dals & poha and transfer everything to a high speed blender.</li>
        <li>Add around 1 & 1/4 cups (10 oz/300 ml) + 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 ml) cold water or as needed to grind the batter to a smooth paste (total water around 315-330 ml). The amount of water needed will depend on the type of rice/dal you use, so it might
            change. So start with a lesser amount and adjust accordingly. I use the smoothie button on my blendtec or the soup button to grind the batter.</li>
        <li>Now, transfer the batter to the steel bowl of your Instant Pot.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of rock salt (sendha namak) to the batter. Do not use regular iodine salt here. If you live in a warm place, you may skip the salt at this point. Using your hands, mix the salt into the batter for 2 minutes. This helps in fermentation.</li>
        <li>The consistency of the batter should be free flowing, but it shouldn’t be runny and it shouldn't be thick either, a thick batter won't ferment.</li>
    </ol>
