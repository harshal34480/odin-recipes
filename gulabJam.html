    <p>While making the dough: the dough needs to be smooth and soft. So, add warm milk, little by little until you have a soft dough. But at the same time, you also have to keep in mind that you don’t want to over knead the dough. Mix until the dough comes
        together and then let it rest for 15-20 minutes. While making the gulab jamun balls: use soft hands and do not apply too much pressure while rolling the balls. Work with soft hands! The gulab jamun balls should be totally smooth without any crack.
        If you see cracks on top, knead again till it’s all smooth. While frying the gulab jamuns: the most important thing is to fry at medium-low heat. If you fry at high heat, the jamuns will not be cooked from inside and will also turn hard. It’s
        best to first heat oil/ghee at medium heat for 5 minutes, then low the heat to low and then drop the balls in the oil. Fry on low heat until they are nice dark golden brown in color. This will take time as you fry on low heat, be patient. Making
        the sugar syrup: Don’t look for any consistency while making the sugar syrup. Add all ingredients for the syrup in a pan and once it comes to a boil, let it simmer for 5 to 6 minutes only. It should only be little sticky. You don’t want to get
        to any thread consistency stage. The syrup might look thin to you after simmering for 5 minutes but that’s plenty. It thickens up as it cools. You don’t want a thick sugar syrup to begin with else the jamuns will never absorb it. Adding the gulab
        jamuns to syrup: while adding the jamuns to the syrup, make sure the syrup is warm but not hot. The gulab jamuns will likely lose their shape if the syrup is too hot and they will not absorb the syrup if the syrup is cold. So warm is what you
        need.

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup finely grated khoya [dried milk]</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour [maida] 33 grams</li>
        <li>pinch cardamom powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons melted ghee</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons warm milk as needed to knead the dough</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large mix together grated khoya, maida (all purpose flour), cardamom powder and baking powder. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add melted ghee to the bowl. Use your fingers to mix ghee with the khoya and maida</li>
        <li>Start adding warm milk, little by little until it all comes together as a dough. Don’t knead the dough too much. Just bring it all together to a smooth dough. Cover and let it rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile to wide a pan add sugar, water, cardamom powder, rose water and kewra essence (if using).</li>
        <li>Bring it to a boil. Add lemon juice. Then lower the heat and let the syrup simmer for 5 to 6 minutes. Once it’s a little sticky after 5 minutes, remove pan from heat and set aside. Keep it warm.</li>
        <li>Now give a quick knead to the dough. Make a small ball out of it. Work with soft hands and squeeze the ball between your palm to shape it. Form a smooth round ball with no cracks.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining dough. I got 14 balls of 15 grams each.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in wide kadai/pan on medium heat. Heat oil for 5 minutes on medium heat and then lower the heat to low-medium. Add the jamuns to the warm (not hot) oil. Fry until golden-brown. This will take few minutes, keep rotating the jamuns regularly
            with a spatula so that they get cooked evenly. </li>
        <li>Once they are dark brown in color, remove them from the oil.</li>
        <li>Drop the gulab jamuns in warm (not hot & not cold) sugar syrup. Let it soak the syrup for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with pistachios and serve warm or cold. You may also decorate them with edible silver leaf (chandi ka vark).</li>
    </ol>
